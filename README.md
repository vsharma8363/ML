### [Quantization](https://github.com/vsharma8363/ML/tree/main/Optimizations/Quantization)

- What it is:
    - Process of converting some/all of the numeric representation of a model (weights/biases/etc.) to integers for smaller size and faster runtime

- When to use it:
    - You need **faster execution** or **reduced model size**
